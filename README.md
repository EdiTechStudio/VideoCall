# VideoCall
This is a simple to use, lightweight video calling App made by me using HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

<b>VideoCall</b> converts your video stream into ASCII stream right before transmission, in-order to provide a seamless user experience, simply because transmission of text requires less bandwidth as compared to transmission of a video stream.

Conventional video calling services transmit video and audio, while <b>VideoCall</b> transmits text and audio.
